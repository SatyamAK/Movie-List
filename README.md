# movie_list

A new Flutter project assigned for Selection Process by Yellow Clases.

## Intro

For this project I have used sqflite as local storage/database to store movie list and prerform CRUD operations
i.e Create, Read, Update, Delete.

I have used firebase auth for presistence authentication using google accounts.

I have used stream provider to seperate the logic layer from the UI layer to reduce the recreation of Widgets uneccesarry amount of times.
